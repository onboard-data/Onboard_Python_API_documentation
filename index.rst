This package provides Python bindings to `Onboard Data's <https://onboarddata.io/>`_ building data API, allowing easy and lightweight access to building data.

For example, we can retrieve the last week of temperature data from all Zone Temperature points associated with FCUs in the Laboratory building:

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    import onboard.client
    from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta
    from onboard.client.models import PointSelector, TimeseriesQuery, PointData
    from typing import List
    client = OnboardClient(api_key='your-api-key-here')

    query = PointSelector()
    query.point_types     = ['Zone Temperature'] # can list multiple
    query.equipment_types = ['fcu']
    query.buildings       = ['Laboratory']
    selection = client.select_points(query)

    start = datetime.now(pytz.utc) - timedelta(days=7)
    end   = datetime.now(pytz.utc)

    timeseries_query = TimeseriesQuery(point_ids = selection['points'], start = start, end = end)
    sensor_data = points_df_from_streaming_timeseries(client.stream_point_timeseries(timeseries_query))

.. note::

   While we are committed to backwards-compatibility, this project is under active development. If you discover a feature that would be helpful, or any unexpected behavior, please contact us at xxx@onboarddata.io
